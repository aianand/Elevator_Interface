# C grade Criteria #<br/>
__Issues with design:__<br/>
* The buttons B, 1, 2 are in horizontal order which is not how the order of elevator works<br/>
* The alarm button and the door close buttons<br/>
* Interface does not have audio<br/>
__Reasons__<br/>
* The horizontal order is not suitable as this is not how order of elevator works<br/>
* The buttons being close can confuse the user<br/>
* Might lead to pressing of wrong button<br/>
* The user would not know the direction i.e up/down of elevator<br/>
* Not a lot of features for people with disabilities<br/>
# B grade Criteria<br/>
__Common Uses:__<br/>
* To go to a certain floor up in building<br/>
* to go to certain floor down in building<br/><br/>
* More helpful if i am physically disable<br/>
* Open/close doors of elevator<br/>
__Rare Uses:__<br/>
* Emergency/Help button<br/>
* Alarm Button<br/>
__Does the interface makes common things easier?__<br/>
Yes , it does. It does take you to floors in building. However, with the closing door button, the user can be easily confused between closing door and the alrm button<br/>
__User interaction/ Sequence of Actions__<br/>
* Call the elevator using the outside button located ouutside elevator<br/>
* The elevator door will open automatically<br/>
* Enter the elevator<br/>
* Click the number of the floor you want to go to<br/>
* If there is a time lag or if the elevator is not closing for some reason then the user can use the close button<br/>
* Get off the elevator when the door opens and the elevator stops<br/>
__How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?__<br/>
The  elevator has a really simple panel design so not in need of instructions. It also mentions the floor number besides the button. For people who are blind, it provides braille so that the user  can know which button to press<br/>
__How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?__<br/>
Whenever the user clicks a button, the button lights up and that is how the user feedback is provided. It makes a sound when floor  is reached.<br/>
__Common mistakes__<br/>
* The very common mistake with this design is that it has the closing door button too close with the alarm button so high chances of confusion.<br/>
* Also the emergency button is too low, so might be that a child might press it accidentally. <br/>
__Improvements and justifications on design decisions__
* Make the floors of elevator buttons go in vertical order instead of horizontal starting from 2 at the Top to B at the bottom for basement because that is how the order should be. This is because this elevator does not go hoorizontally but instead vertically.<br/>
* Include a screen panel so that the user can see which floor they have reached or are currently in. This would prevent user from getting off at wrong floors. Also include an arrow so that the user know if thy going up or down<br/>
* Also tell the user when they have reached a certain floor. So something like voice message saying "You have reached this floor". Also helpful for blind people.<br/>
* Include a speaker for the same so taht peoople can hear the voice saying which floor they are on
* Make space between the buttons to avoid confusion.<br/>
* Have the open and close buttons in one row to avoid confusion.<br/>
* Have placed alarm button and emergency/help buttons in one row rather than having iit at two different places to make actions quiker by user in case of emergency.<br/>
* Have placed all the buttons regarding non user panel on the top because it is rarely used while using the elevator and mostly used by repair men so that way users are not distracted by the non user panel.<br/>

# A Grade Criteria
 The size  requiremnts __9.74 × 7.02 × 0.23 in__
 * I have used adobe xd and in orderv to view the demo, you must sign in with adobe account.
 *  For the purpose of this project I have tried to implement all the designs that I mentioned in the upper section in the Touchscreen    interface
 * As it is  just a prototype, that is why all the buttons , do not function.
 * In the demo, I try to show that assuming the user is on first floor then the elevator is now displaying 1 on the screen
 * And user wants to go to second floor then the user can touch secoond floor from panel and then the elevator screen would display number 1 and an upwards arrow  indicating that it is going up and then then when it reaches second florr, the screen would  display number 2 and simultaneously the user will hear a voice from the speaker saying "Second floor". So this way the user knows that they have  reccahed ther destination
 * These are the only working buttons/ functionalities that I was able to show for this prototype because of time constraint and my limited knowledge of processing and adobe xd.
 
 * The elevator gives user feedback by showing numbers and arrows on screen and also giving voice message
 * So in this way, it is definitely useful for people with disabilities such as blindness.
