**C grade Criteria**<br/>
**Issues with design:**<br/>

* The buttons B, 1, 2 are in horizontal order which is not how the order of elevator works<br/>
* The alarm button and the door close buttons <br/>
* Interface does not have audio<br/>
<br/>
**Reasons**
<br/>
* 	The horizontal order is not suitable as this is not how order of elevator works<br/>
* 	The buttons being close can confuse the user<br/>
*  Might lead to pressing of wrong button<br/>
* The user would not know the direction i.e up/down of elevator<br/>
* No features for people with disabilities<br/>
