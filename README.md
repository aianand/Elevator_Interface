**C grade Criteria**<br/>
**Issues with design:**<br/>

* The buttons B, 1, 2 are in horizontal order which is not how the order of elevator works<br/>
* The alarm button and the door close buttons <br/>
* Interface does not have audio<br/>
<br/>
**Reasons**
<br/>
* The horizontal order is not suitable as this is not how order of elevator works<br/>
* The buttons being close can confuse the user<br/>
* Might lead to pressing of wrong button<br/>
* The user would not know the direction i.e up/down of elevator<br/>
* No features for people with disabilities<br/>

**B grade Criteria**<br/>
**Common Uses:**<br/>
* To go to a certain floor up in building<br/>
* to go to certain floor down in building<br/><br/>
* More helpful if i am physically disable<br/>
* Open/close doors of elevator<br/>
**Rare Uses:**<br/>
* Emergency/Help button<br/>
* Alarm Button<br/>
**Does the interface makes common things easier?**
Yes , it does. It does take you to floors in building. However, with the closing door button, the user can be easily confused between<br/>
closing door and the alrm button<br/>
**User interaction/ Sequence of Actions**<br/>
* Call the elevator using the outside button located ouutside elevator<br/>
* The elevator door will open automatically<br/>
* Enter the elevator<br/>
* Click the number of the floor you want to go to<br/>
* If there is a time lag or if the elevator is not closing for some reason then the user can use the close button<br/>
* Get off the elevator when the door opens and the elevator stops<br/>
