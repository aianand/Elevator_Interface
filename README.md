**C grade Criteria**<br/>
**Issues with design:**<br/>
* The buttons B, 1, 2 are in horizontal order which is not how the order of elevator works<br/>
* The alarm button and the door close buttons<br/>
* Interface does not have audio<br/>
**Reasons**
<br/>
* The horizontal order is not suitable as this is not how order of elevator works<br/>
* The buttons being close can confuse the user<br/>
* Might lead to pressing of wrong button<br/>
* The user would not know the direction i.e up/down of elevator<br/>
* Not a lot of features for people with disabilities<br/>
**B grade Criteria**<br/>
**Common Uses:**<br/>
* To go to a certain floor up in building<br/>
* to go to certain floor down in building<br/><br/>
* More helpful if i am physically disable<br/>
* Open/close doors of elevator<br/>
**Rare Uses:**<br/>
* Emergency/Help button<br/>
* Alarm Button<br/>
**Does the interface makes common things easier?**<br/>
Yes , it does. It does take you to floors in building. However, with the closing door button, the user can be easily confused between closing door and the alrm button<br/>
**User interaction/ Sequence of Actions**<br/>
* Call the elevator using the outside button located ouutside elevator<br/>
* The elevator door will open automatically<br/>
* Enter the elevator<br/>
* Click the number of the floor you want to go to<br/>
* If there is a time lag or if the elevator is not closing for some reason then the user can use the close button<br/>
* Get off the elevator when the door opens and the elevator stops<br/>
**How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?**<br/>
The  elevator has a really simple panel design so not in need of instructions. It also mentions the floor number besides the button. For people who are blind, it provides braille so that the user  can know which button to press<br/>
**How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?**<br/>
Whenever the user clicks a button, the button lights up and that is how the user feedback is provided. It makes a sound when floor  is reached.
**Common mistakes**<br/>
* The very common mistake with this design is that it has the closing door button too close with the alarm button so high chances of confusion.<br/>
* Also the emergency button is too low, so might be that a chiild mmight press it accidentally.
